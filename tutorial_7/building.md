## Building the package

Now you can go ahead and build the package by running the make command.

```
make
```

After a minute or two (depending on the speed of the computer), the executables will be created. You can check to see everything compiled successfully by typing

```
make check
```


If everything is okay, you can now install the package.

```
make install
```

This will install the files into the ~/units174 directory you created earlier.
