**1.1 Listing files and directories**

`ls` (list)

When you first login, your current working directory is your home directory. Your home directory has the same name as your user-name, for example, *ee91ab*, and it is where your personal files and subdirectories are saved.

To find out what is in your home directory, type

`ls`

The `ls` command ( lowercase L and lowercase S ) lists the contents of your current working directory.
