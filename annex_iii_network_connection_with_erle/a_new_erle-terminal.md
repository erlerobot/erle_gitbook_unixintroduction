## A new Erle-terminal

After doing the connection proceess, you can launch as many shells as you want in a simply way. We are going to use `ssh` command in the computer-terminal, which allows you logging into a remote machine and executing commands on that machine.
The syntaxis is easy:

```
ssh usuario@id
```
In our case:
```
ssh root@11.0.0.1
```
