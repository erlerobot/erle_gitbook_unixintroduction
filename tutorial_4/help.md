#####On-line Manuals

There are on-line manuals which gives information about most commands. The manual pages tell you which options a particular command can take, and how each option modifies the behaviour of the command. Type man command to read the manual page for a particular command.

For example, to find out more about the wc (word count) command, type

```
 man wc
 ```

Alternatively

```
 whatis wc
 ```


gives a one-line description of the command, but omits any information about options etc.

For some commands you can simply type
```
help cd
```
this command display helpful information about builtin commands.

##### Apropos

When you are not sure of the exact name of a command,

```
apropos keyword
```

will give you the commands with keyword in their manual page header. For example, try typing

```
apropos copy
```
