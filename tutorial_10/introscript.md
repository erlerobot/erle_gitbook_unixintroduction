####10.1 Introduction to shell script

A command file, batch file or **script** is usually a simple program, which is usually stored in a plain text file. The script is almost always interpreted, but not all interpreted program is considered a script. The common use of scripts is to perform various tasks such as combining components, interact with the operating system or with the user. The shells are usually the interpreters of such programs.
