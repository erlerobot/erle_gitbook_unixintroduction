#### 9.1 What is *vi* ?

*vi* is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix  operating system.
*vi* was designed for editing standard format file and nowadays can be use in a wide variety of sistems and terminals. One of the strong points of *vi* is its adaptability.
For Linux, exits a improved text editor called *vim*. One of the advantages of *vim* is the ability to undo receding one by one the latest changes.*Vim* also allows highlighting the certain files  syntax such as  .shellscript, html, C language, and other
many languages. These and other details make it very suitable for programming.
*Erlerobot* uses vim. You can find out this by typing:
```
vi
```

#### Practical introduction to *vim*

We are going to familiarize with the *vim* text editor by doing some practical examples.For now on, we are *working with erlerobot*.

First, go to erle home and create a directory, called *linuxpractice*, where we are going to save the files.
Create and open with *vim* a .txt file, using `vi`.

![vim1](img9/1vim.jpg)

We are going to number the lines and show the mode we are working on, type :
```
: (press enter)
(you are in the ex mode)
:set showmode (press enter)
:set nu (press enter)
```
Press `i ` and type what you want. Remember: press *enter* to continue writing in the next line. When you finish typing press *escape* and ZZ for save and leave.

![vim2](img9/2vim.jpg)

If you type
```
cat example1.txt
```
You can see what you have written in the file:

![vim3](img9/vim3.jpg)


Open again the file by typing:
```
vi example1.txt
```
After opening it:
```
:(press enter)
:set nu (press enter)
:set showmode(press enter)
```

*Question:*  What should be the result of doing...?
```
:5 (press enter)
dd
```

![vim4](img9/vim4.jpg)

*Question:*  What should be the result of doing...?
```
:1(press enter)
yy
:4
p
```
![vim5](img9/vim5.jpg)


Leave and save using
```
:(press enter)
:wq (press enter)
```

Now we are going to remove the *wrining permissions*. This means that *example1.txt* should be a *readonly* file.
```
chmod 444 example1.txt
```
If you open the file with `vi` ,you will find a warn message at the end of the file:

![vim6](img9/vim6.jpg)

Type
```
:(press enter)
:3 (press enter)
dd (press escape)
:5 (press enter)
R
This is the end of the file for now.
```
The aspect of the file is:

![vim7](img9/vim7.jpg)

If you try to save and leave using:
```
(press escape)
ZZ
```
you get this message:
```
E45: 'readonly' option is set (add ! to override)
```
You can overwrite the file and save the changes forcing:
```
(press escape)
:w!
```

**Exercise:**

Create a file in *linuxpractice* directory and call it erle_description.txt
Write a short description of erlerobot (3 lines).
After that leave two blank lines and write your name.
Save the changes and leave.

If you do `cat`the result should be something like this:

![exp1](img9/vimex.jpg)

Now try to delete the line 4 and to write your name in the first line.
The final result is the following one:
