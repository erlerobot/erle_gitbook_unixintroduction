## Making Directories

`mkdir `(make directory)

We will now make a subdirectory in your home directory to hold the files you will be creating and using in the course of this tutorial. To make a subdirectory called unixstuff in your current working directory type

```
 mkdir unixstuff
 ```


To see the directory you have just created, type

```
ls
```
