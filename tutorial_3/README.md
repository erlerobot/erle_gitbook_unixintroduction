####3.1 Redirection

Most processes initiated by UNIX commands write to the standard output (that is, they write to the terminal screen), and many take their input from the standard input (that is, they read it from the keyboard). There is also the standard error, where processes write their error messages, by default, to the terminal screen.

We have already seen one use of the `cat` command to write the contents of a file to the screen.

Now type `cat `without specifing a file to read
```
 cat
 ```

Then type a few words on the keyboard and press the [Return] key.

Finally hold the [Ctrl] key down and press [d] (written as ^D for short) to end the input.

*What has happened?*

If you run the `cat` command without specifing a file to read, it reads the standard input (the keyboard), and on receiving the 'end of file' (^D), copies it to the standard output (the screen).

In UNIX, we can redirect both the input and the output of commands.

####3.2 Redirecting the Output

We use the > symbol to redirect the output of a command. For example, to create a file called list1 containing a list of fruit, type
```
cat > list1
```

Then type in the names of some fruit. Press [Return] after each one.
```
pear
banana
apple
^D {this means press [Ctrl] and [d] to stop}
```

What happens is the `cat` command reads the standard input (the keyboard) and the > redirects the output, which normally goes to the screen, into a file called list1

To read the contents of the file, type

```
 cat list1
 ```


As *exercise*, using the above method, try to create another file called list2 containing the following fruit: orange, plum, mango, grapefruit. Read the contents of list2



####3.2.1 Appending to a file

The form >> appends standard output to a file. So to add more items to the file list1, type

```
 cat >> list1
 ```

Then type in the names of more fruit
```
peach
grape
orange
^D (Control D to stop)
```

To read the contents of the file, type

```
 cat list1
 ```

You should now have two files. One contains six fruit, the other contains four fruit.

We will now use the `cat` command to join (concatenate) list1 and list2 into a new file called biglist. Type

```
 cat list1 list2 > biglist
 ```

What this is doing is reading the contents of list1 and list2 in turn, then outputing the text to the file biglist

To read the contents of the new file, type

```
 cat biglist
 ```
 Notice that > writes over the content of the file, while >> writes at the end of the content of the file.

####3.3 Redirecting the Input

We use the < symbol to redirect the input of a command.

The command `sort` alphabetically or numerically sorts a list. Type

```
 sort
 ```

Then type in the names of some animals. Press [Return] after each one.
```
dog
cat
bird
ape
^D (control d to stop)
```

The output will be
```
ape
bird
cat
dog
````

Using < you can redirect the input to come from a file rather than the keyboard. For example, to sort the list of fruit, type

```
sort < biglist
```

and the sorted list will be output to the screen.

To output the sorted list to a file, type,

```
sort < biglist > slist
```

Use cat to read the contents of the file slist

####3.4 Pipes

To see who is on the system with you, type

```
 who
 ```

One method to get a sorted list of names is to type,

```
 who > names.txt
 sort < names.txt
 ```

This is a bit slow and you have to remember to remove the temporary file called names when you have finished. What you really want to do is connect the output of the who command directly to the input of the sort command. This is exactly what pipes do. The symbol for a pipe is the vertical bar |

For example, typing

```
who | sort
```

will give the same result as above, but quicker and cleaner.

To find out how many users are logged on, type

```
 who | wc -l
 ```
As *exercise* using pipes, display all lines of list1 and list2 containing the letter 'p', and sort the result. (Remenber: `grep` command search for keyword-keyletter)
*Result:  cat list1 list2 | grep p | sort*

At this point you are ready to do something more practical with your erlerobot. In this [tutorial](http://erlerobot.github.io/erle_gitbook/en/Blink.html) explains how to blink a Led.It is a very good way of practicing some of the things you have learned till the moment.
