####2.1 Creating files (required for next steps)

If you want to create a file you should use the command `touch`. First go to the directory where you are working using`cd`. Then create the file by typing:
```
touch science.txt
```
Now that the file is created you can write on it by using the command `echo`. First let's see what does this command.Type:
```
echo 'Hello'
```
You can read on your shell screen the text you have written between the '', *Hello* in this case.

If you type
```
echo 'Hello' > science.txt
```
You will have written the text onto the file.
Note: the > is a redirection character, we will matter about the this characters in the *tutorial 3*.
