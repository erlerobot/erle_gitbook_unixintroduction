#### Change to a different directory

`cd `(change directory)

The command `cd` directory means change the current working directory to 'directory'. The current working directory may be thought of as the directory you are in, i.e. your current position in the file-system tree.

To change to the directory you have just made, type

```
cd unixstuff
```

Type `ls` to see the contents (which should be empty)

As an **exercise** you can try to make another directory inside the unixstuff directory called backups.
